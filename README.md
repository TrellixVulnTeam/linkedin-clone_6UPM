## linkedin-clone
- This is a linkedin clone that I built with react js, redux and firebase.
- Used styled components to style my components.
- Used firebase for hosting and as a database.
- Used Google to authenticate and sign in users.
- Used a popular state management tool called redux with the help of redux thunk.
- Check master branch for this project's code.
